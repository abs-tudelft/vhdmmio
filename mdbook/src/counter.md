# `counter` behavior

Similar to `flag` fields, `counter`s are used to signal events from
hardware to software. However, counters allow multiple events occurring
between consecutive software read cycles to be registered by counting
instead of bit-setting. Like `flag`, software should use fields of this
type by reading the value and then writing the read value to it in order
to avoid missing events; the write operation subtracts the written value
from the internal register.

This structure supports the following configuration keys.

## `hw-read`

Configure the existence and behavior of the hardware read port.

The following values are supported:

 - `disabled` (default): no read port is generated.

 - `simple`: only the data output is generated.

This key is optional unless required by context. If not specified, the default value (`disabled`) is used.

## `hw-write`

Configure the existence and behavior of the hardware write port.

The following values are supported:

 - `disabled` (default): no write port is generated.

 - `enabled`: a record consisting of a write enable flag and data is generated.

 - `accumulate`: like enabled, but the data is accumulated instead of written.

 - `subtract`: like enabled, but the data is subtracted instead of written.

This key is optional unless required by context. If not specified, the default value (`disabled`) is used.

## `reset`

Configures the reset value.

The following values are supported:

 - `no` (default): the internal data register resets to 0, with the valid flag set.

 - `yes`: the internal data register resets to 1, with the valid flag set.

 - an integer: the internal data register resets to the given value, with the valid flag set.

 - `generic`: the reset value is controlled through a VHDL generic.

This key is optional unless required by context. If not specified, the default value (`no`) is used.

## `ctrl-clear`

Controls the existence of the `ctrl_clear` control input
signal. When this signal is asserted, the internal data register is
cleared. The valid flag is not affected.

The value must be a boolean (default `no`).

This key is optional unless required by context. If not specified, the default value (`no`) is used.

## `ctrl-reset`

Controls the existence of the `ctrl_reset` control input
signal. When this signal is asserted, the field is reset, as if the
register file `reset` input were asserted.

The value must be a boolean (default `no`).

This key is optional unless required by context. If not specified, the default value (`no`) is used.

## `ctrl-increment`

Controls the existence of the `ctrl_increment` control input
signal. When this signal is asserted, the internal data register is
incremented.

The value must be a boolean (default `yes`).

This key is optional unless required by context. If not specified, the default value (`yes`) is used.

## `ctrl-decrement`

Controls the existence of the `ctrl_decrement` control input
signal. When this signal is asserted, the internal data register is
decremented.

The value must be a boolean (default `no`).

This key is optional unless required by context. If not specified, the default value (`no`) is used.
