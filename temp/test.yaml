    This is mostly copypasted from the user manual of the SSP controller of
    the LPC1313 microcontroller (NXP UM10375) to serve as a real-world example
    of a register file description.

- register-name: CR0
  register-brief: SSP Control Register 0.

  mnemonic: DSS

    This field controls the number of bits transferred in each frame. Values
    0000-0010 are not supported and should not be used.

    | Value | Description     |
    |-------|-----------------|
    | 0x3   | 4-bit transfer  |
    | 0x4   | 5-bit transfer  |
    | 0x5   | 6-bit transfer  |
    | 0x6   | 7-bit transfer  |
    | 0x7   | 8-bit transfer  |
    | 0x8   | 9-bit transfer  |
    | 0x9   | 10-bit transfer |
    | 0xA   | 11-bit transfer |
    | 0xB   | 12-bit transfer |
    | 0xC   | 13-bit transfer |
    | 0xD   | 14-bit transfer |
    | 0xE   | 15-bit transfer |
    | 0xF   | 16-bit transfer |

- address: 0x0000:5..4
  type: control
  mnemonic: FRF
  name: frame_format
  brief: Frame Format.

    | Value | Description   |
    |-------|---------------|
    | 0x0   | SPI           |
    | 0x1   | TI            |
    | 0x2   | Microwire     |
    | 0x3   | Not supported |

- address: 0x0000:6
  type: control
  mnemonic: CPOL
  name: clock_polarity
  brief: Clock Out Polarity.
  doc: |
    This bit is only used in SPI mode.

    When 0, the SSP controller maintains the bus clock low between frames.

    When 1, the SSP controller maintains the bus clock high between frames.

- address: 0x0000:7
  type: control
  mnemonic: CPHA
  name: clock_phase
  brief: Clock Out Phase.
  doc: |
    This bit is only used in SPI mode.

    When 0, the SSP controller captures serial data on the first clock
    transition of the frame, that is, the transition *away from* the inter
    frame state of the clock line.

    When 1, the SSP controller captures serial data on the second clock
    transition of the frame, that is, the transition back to the inter-frame
    state of the clock line.

- address: 0x0000:15..8
  type: control
  mnemonic: SCR
  name: prescaler
  brief: Serial Clock Rate.
  doc: |
    The number of prescaler-output clocks per bit on the bus, minus one.
    Given that CPSDVSR is the prescale divider, and the APB clock PCLK clocks
    the prescaler, the bit frequency is PCLK / (CPSDVSR x [SCR+1]).

- register-name: CR1
  register-brief: SSP Control Register 1.

  address: 0x0004:0
  type: control
  mnemonic: LBM
  name: loopback
  brief: Loop Back Mode.
  doc: |
    When 0, the SSP behaves normally. When 1, serial input is taken from the
    serial output (MOSI or MISO) rather than the serial input pin (MISO or MOSI
    respectively).

- address: 0x0004:1
  mnemonic: SSE
  name: enable
  brief: SSP Enable.
  doc: |
    When 0, the SSP is disabled. When 1, the SSP controller will interact with
    other devices on the serial bus. Software should write the appropriate
    control information to the other SSP registers and interrupt controller
    registers, before setting this bit.

- address: 0x0004:2
  type: control
  mnemonic: MS
  name: mode
  brief: Master/Slave Mode.
  doc: |
    This bit can only be written when the SSE bit is 0. When 0, the SSP
    controller acts as a master on the bus, driving the SCLK, MOSI, and SSEL
    lines and receiving the MISO line. When 1, the SSP controller acts as a
    slave on the bus, driving MISO line and receiving SCLK, MOSI, and SSEL
    lines.

- address: 0x0004:3
  type: control
  mnemonic: SOD
  name: output_disable
  brief: Slave Output Disable.
  doc: |
    This bit is relevant only in slave mode (MS = 1). If it is 1, this blocks
    this SSP controller from driving the transmit data line (MISO).
