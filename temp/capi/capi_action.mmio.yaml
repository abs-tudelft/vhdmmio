  name: capi_action
  brief: MMIO-Map Action Space.
  doc: |
    Each action has a 4KB MMIO space which can be accessed from a master
    context or from a slave context using the address ranges as described in
    the respective MMIO-Map above.

    The following MMIO registers have dedicated meanings within the SNAP
    framework. When the Action gets created using Xilinx HLS the registers
    marked as "Reserved" are required for HLS control information. Otherwise,
    they may be used for any purpose.
